#### Elaboration:
If we consider this list of tokens as a sentence, then the x is the list up to the last value, and the label is the last value which in this case is 70.
The y is a one-hot encoded array whether length is the size of the corpus of words and the value that is set to one is the one at the index of the label
which in this case is the 70th element.
